          <h3>Fund Me</h3>
          <p>
            This is simple "FundMe" contract in Solidity. A smart contract on
            the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to send Ether to the
            contract, typically for funding purposes. This type of contract is
            often used for crowdfunding, donations, or similar activities.

            <h3>Key Features: </h3>
            <br >
            <li>
            Accepting Funds: The contract allows users to send Ether to it.
            </li>
            <br >
            <li>
            Tracking Funders: It keeps track of who sent funds and how much
              they sent.
            </li>
            <br >
            <li>
            Owner Withdrawal: Only the owner (the person who deployed the
              contract) can withdraw the funds.
            </li>

          <h3>LSD(Life support development)</h3>
          <p>Many individuals experience anxiety or panic attacks but may struggle to document and understand their occurrences adequately. Existing methods often lack specificity, merely noting the event's happening without delving into crucial details such as symptoms, triggers, and control measures. This deficiency impedes users ability to gain self-awareness, track progress, and identify patterns, ultimately hindering effective management of their condition. To address this, there is a need for a comprehensive reporting system that prompts users to provide detailed information about their anxiety or panic attacks, empowering them to gain insights, receive personalized support, and access tailored interventions.</p>
